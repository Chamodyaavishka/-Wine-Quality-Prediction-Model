## Wine Quality Prediction Model

#### Objective:
This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The goal is to understand the factors that contribute to the wine's quality and to apply predictive analytics to assist in wine quality assessment.

#### Methodology:

Data Preparation: The dataset contains several variables related to wine characteristics such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and others. The data undergoes preprocessing steps including scaling and handling of categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration includes generating histograms, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.
Feature Engineering: Based on the EDA, certain features are transformed or selected for model training to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Multiple models including Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier are trained using the dataset.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to understand each model's effectiveness in predicting wine quality.
#### Technologies Used:

Python programming language with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning model development.


#### Outcome:
The project provides insights into the attributes that most significantly impact wine quality and evaluates different models to determine the best predictor of wine quality. This application could be used by winemakers and vendors to ensure quality control and improve wine production processes.
